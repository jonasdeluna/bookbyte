## Add or remove books (us-1)
As a librarian, I want to add new books or remove books that are no longer in the library so that customers can borrow the latest books and avoid borrowing books that are no longer available for use.

Each book has a unique identifier in the form of a barcode at the back of the book. This unique identifier should be written into a text field. The system should not add the book to the system if that unique identifier is already in use.
